# CR-GSL
This project provides a description of the data used in the article ‘Anomaly recognition method for cigarette-rolling process based on graph structure learning’ and showcases a small portion of the data utilized in the article.

The data corresponds to Table 2 in Section 4.1 of the article. This multivariate time series includes 27 indicators for 10,000 cigarettes. During the production process, 27 indicators were collected for each cigarette, covering three steps: VE, SE, and MAX.
#
No.	Indicator Name			No.	Indicator Name		
1	Suction tape tension pressure			15	Weight of cigarette in sections 4		
2	Suction rod conveyor vacuum pressure			16	Weight of cigarette in sections 5		
3	Pressure of primary separator			17	Tobacco temperature		
4	Suction tape Initial position			18	Speed of machine operation		
5	Suction tape position			19	MAX gas source pressure		
6	SE belt tension 			20	MAX large fan pressure		
7	SE gas source pressure			21	Rolling plate temperature 		
8	Sealer temperature			22	Ignition end density		
9	Spider hand small fan pressure			23	Cigarette OTIS		
10	Cigarette bar total weight			24	Cap gas source pressure average		
11	Position of compaction end			25	Draw resistance		
12	Weight of cigarette in sections 1			26	Ventilating strength		
13	Weight of cigarette in sections 2			27	Air leakage		
14	Weight of cigarette in sections 3						
The blue, orange, and green indicators are VE, SE, and MAX respectively
