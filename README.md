# CR-GSL
This project provides a description of the data used in the article ‘Anomaly recognition method for cigarette-rolling process based on graph structure learning’ and showcases a small portion of the data utilized in the article.

The data corresponds to Table 2 in Section 4.1 of the article. This multivariate time series includes 27 indicators for 10,000 cigarettes. During the production process, 27 indicators were collected for each cigarette, covering three steps: VE, SE, and MAX.

The implementation of the CR-GSL is conducted on a computer equipped with a Microsoft Windows 10 operating system, an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6226R CPU, 128GB RAM, and a GPU of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080. The software-related is Python 3.6, cuda 10.2, Pytorch 1.5.1.


Since the data was initially processed using MATLAB, only '.mat' files are provided here for reference. If specific data in CSV format is required, please contact the authors to obtain it.
